Hey what's up, we are the CV gang gang, a group of Georgia Tech CS students taking the class [Introduction to Computer Vision](https://arjunmajum.github.io/fa20cs4476/), led by professor [Devi Parikh](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~parikh/). The class has a semester-long project, and we decided to do it on intelligent captioning of videos. You can read all about it here: [Proposal]({% post_url 2020-09-30-kickoff %}).
